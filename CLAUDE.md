# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a knowledge base directory containing research documents and materials rather than a software development project. The repository contains:

- PDF documents on various topics including steel production, temperature control, and AI adoption
- Audio files (WAV format)

## Working with this Repository

Since this is a document repository rather than a codebase:

- No build, test, or lint commands are applicable
- No software architecture exists to navigate
- Primary tasks will involve document analysis, content extraction, or file management
- When working with PDFs, use the Read tool to extract and analyze content
- Audio files can be referenced but cannot be processed directly

## Common Tasks

- Document analysis and summarization
- Content extraction from PDFs
- File organization and management
- Research and information gathering from the knowledge base

## Notes

This repository does not contain source code or development tools. Future Claude Code instances should expect to work primarily with document processing and knowledge management tasks rather than software development.
